title: My experiences of learning English

---

I began to learn English in Middle School. 

At first, learning English was frustrating. Because I always spoke English sentences with some Chinese words. But later I believed learning English would be one of my most rewarding experiences. My teacher was so strict with us that I made every effort to finish my work. Soon I made great progress. My English teacher encouraged us to read more, listen more and speak more. Not only did I gained self-confidence from his words but also I become positive in getting more English knowledge. 

Writing English diaries was always an easy way to learn English grammar wel
