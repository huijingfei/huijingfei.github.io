My company's colleagues need Internet Explorer mode to visit outdated banking sites, comes with many problems in Internet Explorer, and Microsoft decided to permanently remove IE browser (Windows 10/11) on February 14, 2023. Edge comes with Internet Explorer mode, but Edge cann't change Internet Explorer mode automaticlly and has a 30 days limit for cutom rules. 

Recently I tried a variety of dual-kernel browser like 360, Sogou and QQ browser. To be honest I don't trust these softwares from Chinese tech giant, after installing them, I decided to search for the IE extension that was once available in Chrome and FireFox.

------------------------------------------------------

Now Chrome and FireFox extensions are also not good choices, an additional executable file is required after installation, and we need to pay for advanced features.

**The following is a discription from IE Tab official website.**

Did IE Tab always require this extra program?

No. Chrome used to support a technology called NPAPI (the Netscape Plugin API) which allowed extensions to access local computer resources. IE Tab used to use that functionality to access the Internet Explorer rendering engine. But Chrome removed NPAPI support, so we were forced to implement a new solution, and that solution requires a separate helper executable.

From a technical standpoint, the only real change is that our code moved from an NPAPI .DLL file to a helper .EXE file.

## Internet Explorer mode in Pale Moon

Some sites are built to work with Internet Explorer and have functionality that isn't supported by modern browsers such as Chrome/Firefox. If you need to view one of these sites, you can use Internet Explorer Mode in Pale Moon.

Pale Moon is an Open Source, Goanna-based web browser available for various operating systems including Microsoft Windows, Mac OS and Linux (with contributed other operating system support), focusing on efficiency and customization. Make sure to get the most out of your browser!

You must install Fire IE add-on to use Internet Explorer Mode in Pale Moon, Fire IE is an alternative to IE Tab, a plugin that works very well. This plugin works with old versions of FireFox up to 46.0, and [Pale Moon](https://www.palemoon.org/) is a custom Firefox-based browser that still works with old plugins.

I am currently using 32.0.0 version of the Pale Moon, you can install Fire IE to use Pale Moon directly open this URL [Fire-IE](https://github.com/yxl/Fire-IE/releases/download/0.4.6.2/fireie-0.4.6.2-unified.xpi).

If you can not visit GitHub, you can visit this URL [Fire IE (FireIE, Enhanced IE)](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-us/firefox/addon/fire-ie/?src=search) to add Fire IE, but you need to change the UA first, Pale Moon has the advantage that you can change the UA separately for specific sites, the method is as follows:

**1: Input about:config in the address bar to enter the advanced preferences.**

    about:config

**2: Right click ➡️ New ➡️ String input the preference name**

    general.useragent.override.addons.thunderbird.net

------------------------------------------------------

**3: Press the 'OK' button, then input the preference value**

    Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:56.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/56.0

------------------------------------------------------

**4: Press the 'OK' button to finish changing UA, and then visit [Fire IE (FireIE, Enhanced IE)](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-us/firefox/addon/fire-ie/?src=search) again to add Fire IE.**

The extension [FireFox](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-us/firefox/addon/fire-ie/) is for low versions of Firefox up to 46.0, personally, I recommend using Pale Moon, still under development.
