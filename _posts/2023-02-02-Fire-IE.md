My company's colleagues need IE to visit outdated banking sites, comes with many problems in Internet Explorer, and Microsoft decided to permanently remove IE browser (Windows 10/11) on February 14, 2023. Edge comes with IE mode, but Edge cann't change IE mode automaticlly and has a 30 days limit for cutom rules.

Recently I tried a variety of dual-core browser like 360, Sogou and QQ browser. To be honest I don't trust these softwares from Chinese tech giant, after installing them, I decided to search for the IE extension that was once available in Chrome and FireFox.

------------------------------------------------------

Now Chrome and FireFox extensions are also not good choices, an additional executable file is required after installation, and we need to pay for advanced features.

The following is a discription from IE Tab official website.

Did IE Tab always require this extra program?

No. Chrome used to support a technology called NPAPI (the Netscape Plugin API) which allowed extensions to access local computer resources. IE Tab used to use that functionality to access the Internet Explorer rendering engine. But Chrome removed NPAPI support, so we were forced to implement a new solution, and that solution requires a separate helper executable.

From a technical standpoint, the only real change is that our code moved from an NPAPI .DLL file to a helper .EXE file.

------------------------------------------------------

I happened to search for Fire IE, an alternative to IE Tab, a plugin that works very well. This plugin works with older versions of FireFox up to 46.0, and there is a custom Firefox-based browser Pale Moon that still works with older plugins.

I am currently using 32.0.0, you can install Fire IE to use Pale Moon directly open this URL [Fire-IE](https://github.com/yxl/Fire-IE/releases/download/0.4.6.2/fireie-0.4.6.2-unified.xpi).

If you can not access GitHub, you can visit this URL [SeaMonkey](https://addons.thunderbird.net/zh-cn/seamonkey/addon/fire-ie/) to add Fire IE, but you need to change the UA first, Pale Moon has the advantage that you can change the UA separately for specific sites, the method is as follows.

1: Enter about:config in the address bar to enter the advanced settings.

2: Right click>New>String input 

------------------------------------------------------

    general.useragent.override.addons.thunderbird.net

------------------------------------------------------

Click Enter, then input 

------------------------------------------------------

    Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:91.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0 SeaMonkey/2.22.15

------------------------------------------------------

Click Enter.

3: After changing UA, visit [SeaMonkey](https://addons.thunderbird.net/zh-cn/seamonkey/addon/fire-ie/) again to add Fire IE.

This URL [FireFox](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-us/firefox/addon/fire-ie/) is for low versions of Firefox up to 46.0, personally, I recommend using Pale Moon, still under development.
